for the reward system, check if the pixel after movement is blue or the color of titanium/outer mithril, reward. Otherwise, punish and bring -reward. If color before movement is blue/titanium/color of mithril punish
, if its color of bedrock, reward!!

only give reward if color before was bedrock and color after movement is mithril, otherwise punish


make a texture pack where titanium and mithril are all one color so it is very easy to mine.

make titanium a different texture to check if mined mithril turns into titanium or bedrock, then figure out a way to remove mining texture -> shouldnt be necessary if block is broken after finishing
